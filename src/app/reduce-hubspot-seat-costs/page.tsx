const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Why is HubSpot expensive for light users?",
    a: "HubSpot's paid Hubs are billed per core seat, and a core seat costs the same whether someone runs pipeline all day or logs in twice a week to update a deal. HubSpot's free view-only seats can't edit records, so the moment a light user needs to change anything, they get pushed onto a full paid seat. The overpayment concentrates on everyone who needs to do a little — which in most teams is the majority.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I cut HubSpot costs without leaving HubSpot?",
    a: "You don't have to migrate. Keep HubSpot as your system of record for the power users who live in it, and give the light users — sales reps checking a few fields, ops staff updating a status, partners submitting requests — a purpose-built portal wired into HubSpot through its API. They read and write the same HubSpot records in real time, on one flat fee no matter how many you add. Nothing gets ripped out.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the fastest way to reduce a HubSpot bill?",
    a: "Reclaim seats nobody uses. Audit your assigned core seats and remove the ones tied to people who left, changed roles, or were provisioned 'just in case.' It's the lowest-risk saving because it changes nothing for active users. After that, right-size occasional users to the cheapest tier that still fits, and move the genuinely light users to a flat-fee portal — that's the lever that stops the bill scaling with headcount.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much can a custom portal save versus HubSpot seats?",
    a: "It depends entirely on how many light users you have and your negotiated per-seat rate, so we won't quote a fixed number. The mechanism is simple: HubSpot seats recur and grow with headcount, while a flat-fee portal costs the same at 10 users or 400. Our savings calculator lets you plug in your seat count and rate to see the comparison for your own situation.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a HubSpot portal keep one source of truth?",
    a: "Yes. The portal integrates two-way with HubSpot, so it reads and writes the same records live. HubSpot stays the single source of truth — the portal is a tailored window into your HubSpot data for the users who only need a slice of it, not a second database that drifts out of sync.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to stand up a HubSpot portal, and what does it cost?",
    a: "Most portals go live in 2–6 weeks via our AI Forge Framework, with a fixed quote within 48 hours of the first call. It runs on one flat monthly subscription — tiers from $3,000–$12,000+/month depending on scope — that covers the build, hosting, and ongoing changes. New customers pay nothing for the one-time build.",

                  HubSpot bills per core seat, and a seat costs the same whether
                  someone lives in it all day or logs in twice a week. So the cost
                  piles up on everyone lighter than a power user — the reps, ops
                  staff, partners, and customers who touch it for a handful of
                  tasks. There are three honest ways to cut that bill, and only one
                  of them requires building anything. Here&apos;s how to decide
